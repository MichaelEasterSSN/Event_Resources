#### Basic checklist for stuff that can be done in advance

* obviously, pre-arrange venue, food, speakers, Wifi details
* does the venue allow minors?
* if minors attend, someone should stay with them until their rides arrive (?)
* do the speakers know how much time they have to present?
* do the speakers have appropriate dongles for the projector?
* do non-regular speakers know they can use a projector, and the # of people in attendance?
* who is doing the "dev news" ? who is covering Twitter / pics?
* who prints the "Hello my name is ..." labels? 
* who is handling door prizes? is Scooter list correct?
* did someone 'announce' via the MeetUp site, and send an email on the day before the event?

#### Basic checklist for stuff that can be done in advance

* obviously, pre-arrange venue, food, speakers, Wifi details
* does the venue allow minors?
* if minors attend, someone should stay with them until their rides arrive (?)
* do the speakers know how much time they have to present?
* do the speakers have appropriate dongles for the projector?
* ask speakers how they would like to be introduced / bio
* do non-regular speakers know they can use a projector, and the # of people in attendance?
* who is doing the "dev news" / Announcements ? who is covering Twitter / pics?
* who is handling door prizes? is Scooter list correct?
* did someone 'announce' via the MeetUp site, and send an email on the day before the event?

#### Lessons learned
* Consider using a timer, esp. for lightning talks. A standard technique is to demo a funny alarm, before the talks begin, and tell everyone that we are setting a timer. In this way, no one is offended by being cut off.
* at CYC, a presenter wanted to play audio clips. We rented cables and an adapter box at Long & McQuade so that we could plug a stereo-mini jack into a Mac, and then a XLR (?) jack into the sound board.
* for long events (e.g. hackathons), be sure to vacate the premises on time. The security staff get upset if we linger around.
* Some elders have registered the notion that the name "hackathon" does not encourage gender-diversity

#### Older stuff
* who prints the "Hello my name is ..." labels?

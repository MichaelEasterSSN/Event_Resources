#### Basic checklist for stuff that can be done in advance

* obviously, pre-arrange venue, food, speakers
* does the venue allow minors?
* if minors attend, someone should stay with them until their rides arrive (?)
* do the speakers know how much time they have to present?
* do the speakers have appropriate dongles for the projector?
* who is doing the "dev news" ?
* who prints the "Hello my name is ..." labels? 
* who is handling door prizes? can they be drawn before the event?
